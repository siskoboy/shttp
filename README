shttp: shitty-p.  Sam Hansens http server.

Requires PLY <http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/>

This is a toy project.  I made some offhand comment that I could probably cook
up a static http server in a few hours or so... so I did.

A few hours in we have a very basic static only http server.

The server utilizes a formal LALR front end parser for requests.  This
greatly simplifies the request processing and allows us to incrementally add
supported protocol features (provided I can keep the grammar un-ambiguous :p).

The servers main path of execution just creates a connection and then enters a
loop calling accept(); fork().  In the child, a request is read, parsed,
dispatched, and the client socket is then closed.  In the parent, the client
socket is immediately shut down (processed by the child process).  This
processing model ("looped" forking loop) was chosen based on its simplicity.

There is a _whole_ lot more to do before we have a simple RFC compliant server.
See the TODO file for a list of things that I might tool around with.

This has been pretty fun to work on :D

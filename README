shttp: shitty-p.  Sam Hansens http server.

Requires PLY <http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/>

This is a toy project.  I made some offhand comment that I could probably cook
up a static http server in a few hours or so.

A few hours in we have a very basic static only http server.

The server utilizes a formal LALR front end parser for requests.  This
greatly simplifies the request processing and allows us to incrementally add
supported protocol features.

There is a _whole_ lot more to do before we have a simple RFC compliant server.
See the TODO file for a list of things that I might tool around with.

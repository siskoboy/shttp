[n] = priority [n+1] has greater priority than [n]

* [7] Implement an argparser.
* [5] I should make more appropriate use of exceptions.  Develop a set of HTTP
  exceptions module (shttp.exceptions).  That might make the flow in the
  HTTPResponse object a little more smooth.
* [11] Implement appropriate SIGCHLD, SIGINT, SIGHUP signal handlers.
* [3] Implement a parsed config file (start with simple args).
* [3] Right now the docroot is just a static configuration.  I should probably
  implement a virtual host mechanism.
* [3] Switch from basic sockets to libcrypto BIO and whatnot (for ssl support).
* [3] The HTTPRequest and HTTPResponse objects are pretty easy to work with, but
  I might have a more general server object. (investigate)
* [7] Import logging!
* [7] Right now the server opens a client socket, processes the request, and
  then closes the socket.  This is obviously not ideal.  Implement a proper
  persistent http client connection - integrate with headers.
* [7] Handle requests for directories (right now they just 403).

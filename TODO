Shopping list o-stuff (in no particular order...)

* Implement an argparser.
* I should make more appropriate use of exceptions.  Develop a set of HTTP
  exceptions module (shttp.exceptions).  That might make the flow in the
  HTTPResponse object a little more smooth.
* Implement appropriate SIGCHLD, SIGINT, SIGHUP signal handlers.
* Implement a parsed config file (start with simple args).
* Right now the docroot is just a static configuration.  I should probably
  implement a virtual host mechanism.
* Switch from basic sockets to libcrypto BIO and whatnot (for ssl support).
* The HTTPRequest and HTTPResponse objects are pretty easy to work with, but I
  might have a more general server object.
* Import logging!
